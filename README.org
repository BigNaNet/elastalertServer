* Elastalert Helm Chart

[elastalert](https://github.com/Yelp/elastalert) is a simple framework for alerting on anomalies, spikes, or other patterns of interest from data in Elasticsearch.

This elastalert is based on the bitsensor docker image [[https://github.com/bitsensor/yelp-elastalert][found here]]

* TL;DR;

** Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
helm install --name my-release stable/elastalert
#+END_SRC

The command deploys elastalert on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [configuration](#configuration) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

** Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the my-release deployment:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
helm delete my-release
#+END_SRC

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.
